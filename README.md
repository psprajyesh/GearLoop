Problem Statement Chosen

We selected the problem statement “Build a Two-Wheeler Marketplace Web App.”
Today, people struggle to find the right bike or scooter. They either visit multiple dealers, deal with confusing prices, or don’t have the right tools to compare and decide. Sellers also find it hard to reach genuine buyers. We wanted to solve this with one simple platform.

Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan

Our idea is called VahanBazar – a one-stop solution for buying, selling, and exploring two-wheelers.
In Phase 1, we focused on the basics: homepage, listings, search, and filters.
In Phase 2, we added smart tools like EMI and fuel cost calculators, 3D bike views, multilingual support, and even voice commands.
In Phase 3, we plan to scale up with dealer dashboards, price alerts, AI recommendations, and expansion to more regions.

Our prototype shows how a user can browse bikes, compare models, check reviews, and even book a test ride—all in a few clicks.

Features to be Implemented

A clean homepage and navigation with light/dark mode.
Listings for both new and used bikes with filters like brand, price, fuel type, and mileage.
Detailed product pages showing specs, images, and offers.
A comparison tool to see two models side by side.
Finance tools like EMI and fuel cost calculators.
Forms for login, signup, and selling your bike.
A showroom directory with test ride booking options.

Upcoming launches to explore future models.

Extra features: multilingual support, voice commands, 3D bike view, reviews, favorites, and alerts.

Tech Stack Used

We chose modern, flexible technologies to make the app smooth and scalable:
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a fast and clean interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.6
Extra Tools: Three.js for 3D bike views, Speech Recognition API for voice search, JWT for secure login.
